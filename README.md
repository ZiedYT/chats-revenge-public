- Advice:
    - First Tab:    
        - The stackable checkbox affects both channel points and bits
        - The other configurations on the first tab affect only affects channel points
    - Configure the bits parameters (eg: duration) in the extension dashboard:
        - You can create multiple variations each with their bits amount:
          - Example: Multiple timeout options, the longer the duration the more bits are needed
      - IF YOU ARE USING TWO VARIATIONS OF THE SAME ACTION (EXAMPLE BITS AND CHANNEL POINTS) MAKE SURE THE STACKABLE PARAMETER IS ON
